git commit -m "✅ Fix Chess.com API integration - GH_Wilder now works!

ISSUE RESOLVED:
- create_user endpoint was rejecting valid Chess.com usernames
- Example: GH_Wilder returned 'user not found' despite being valid

ROOT CAUSES FOUND (via Playwright MCP Research):
1. URL construction bug: urljoin was removing '/pub' from path
2. HTTP client not following 301 redirects for case normalization
3. Missing proper User-Agent header (new Chess.com requirement)
4. Generic error messages didn't differentiate 404 vs 410 vs 429

FIXES APPLIED:
✅ Fixed URL construction (simple concatenation vs urljoin)
✅ Enabled follow_redirects=True in httpx.AsyncClient
✅ Added proper User-Agent with contact info
✅ Enhanced error parsing (404, 410, 429, 503)
✅ User-friendly error messages in API endpoint
✅ Redirect logging for debugging

TESTING:
✅ 8 new integration tests added (all passing)
✅ Real API tested: GH_Wilder, hikaru, etc. - all work!
✅ 31/31 total tests passing
✅ Coverage increased: 49.07% → 50.17% (+1.1%)

RESEARCH METHOD:
- Playwright MCP: Read Chess.com API documentation
- Direct testing: Created test script to verify API behavior
- Discovered: Chess.com returns 301 for mixed-case usernames
- Solution: Follow redirects automatically

FILES CHANGED:
- app/services/chesscom_api.py (URL fix, redirect handling, errors)
- app/api/users.py (better error messages)
- tests/test_chesscom_api_integration.py (8 new tests)
- CHESSCOM_API_FIX_SUMMARY.md (complete documentation)

KEY LEARNINGS:
- Chess.com normalizes usernames via 301 redirects
- httpx requires explicit follow_redirects=True
- User-Agent header now mandatory for Chess.com API
- urljoin has unexpected behavior with paths

VERIFIED:
✅ GH_Wilder (mixed case) works
✅ gh_wilder (lowercase) works
✅ hikaru (famous player) works
✅ Non-existent users show clear errors
✅ Rate limiting handled gracefully

Impact: Users can now register with ANY case username!"
