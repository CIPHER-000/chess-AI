# ðŸš¨ **QUICK FIX: User Not Found Issue**

## Problem
Your user (gh_wilder) was deleted or database was reset after rebuilding Docker backend.

## Solution - Just Re-Create User

### **Step 1: Open Homepage**
```
http://localhost:3001
```

### **Step 2: Enter Username Again**
- Type: `gh_wilder`
- Click: **"Get Started"**

This will:
1. Re-create your user
2. Fetch your 10 games again
3. Redirect to dashboard with games visible

### **Step 3: Verify Dashboard**
```
http://localhost:3001/dashboard?username=gh_wilder
```

You should now see:
- âœ… Games list with 10 games
- âœ… Opponent names, results, dates
- âœ… "Analyze with AI" button working

## Why This Happened

When you rebuilt the Docker backend, the PostgreSQL database **might have been reset** if:
- Volumes were deleted
- Database was cleared
- Container was recreated without preserving data

**This is normal during development!**

---

## Prevention (Optional)

To prevent data loss in future:

### **Option 1: Don't Delete Volumes**
```bash
# Restart containers WITHOUT removing volumes
docker-compose restart

# Stop and start WITHOUT removing volumes
docker-compose stop
docker-compose start
```

### **Option 2: Named Volumes (Already Set)**
Check `docker-compose.yml` has:
```yaml
volumes:
  postgres_data:  # This preserves data between rebuilds
```

## Quick Test

After re-creating user:

### **Test 1: Games Endpoint**
```powershell
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/games/1?limit=20
```
Expected: JSON array of games

### **Test 2: Analyze Endpoint**
Click "Analyze with AI" on dashboard
Expected: Success message, not "User not found"

**Just go to homepage and click "Get Started" again!** ðŸŽ¯
