# üîê SECURITY NOTICE - ACTION REQUIRED

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Security Issue Fixed

**Date**: 2025-10-20  
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Status**: PARTIALLY RESOLVED

### Issue Identified
The OpenAI API key was **hardcoded and exposed** in version control at:
- `.windsurf/mcp/gpt5.mcp.json`

### Actions Taken
‚úÖ Removed hardcoded API key from configuration  
‚úÖ Updated to use environment variable: `${OPENAI_API_KEY}`  
‚úÖ Added `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env.example`  

### REQUIRED ACTION BY YOU

**üö® YOU MUST ROTATE YOUR API KEY IMMEDIATELY üö®**

1. **Go to OpenAI Platform:**
   - Visit: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Locate the key starting with `sk-proj-w3nSFuFg5yeFMjzB3ii...`
   - Click "Revoke" to deactivate it immediately

2. **Generate New Key:**
   - Create a new API key in the OpenAI dashboard
   - Copy the new key securely

3. **Update Local Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file (if it doesn't exist)
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env and add your NEW key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE
   ```

4. **Verify MCP Configuration:**
   - The GPT-5 MCP server will now read from environment variables
   - Restart Windsurf IDE after updating `.env`

### Why This Matters
Exposed API keys can be:
- Used by unauthorized parties
- Result in unexpected charges to your OpenAI account
- Violate OpenAI's terms of service
- Lead to rate limit exhaustion

### Prevention Going Forward
- ‚úÖ Never commit `.env` files (already in `.gitignore`)
- ‚úÖ Use environment variables for all secrets
- ‚úÖ Regularly rotate API keys
- ‚úÖ Use API key restrictions (IP whitelisting, usage limits)

### Git History Consideration
If this repository has been pushed to GitHub/GitLab:
1. The exposed key is **permanently in git history**
2. Even after deletion, it remains in commit history
3. This is why immediate key rotation is critical
4. Consider using tools like `git-filter-repo` to purge history (advanced)

**Next Steps**: Complete the key rotation, then proceed with Supabase migration.
